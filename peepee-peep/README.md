# PeePee Peep

Automation example. In this example there is an event for the unpair of the Aqara sensor. I had not renamed the device, i dont now if the device id is used on the `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/event` topic, or the friendly name.

```yaml
- id: "peepeepeep"
  alias: PeePee Peep
  trigger:
  - platform: mqtt
    topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/event"

    value_template: "{{ value_json.data.ieee_address }}"
    id: unpair
  - platform: state
